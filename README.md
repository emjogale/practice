# Practice project

Originally the idea for this project was for people to practice collaborating on a very simple website and in doing so gain experience working with git and how to use it as version control with multiple contributors.
This is still the aim - and there are various ideas of what the actual website will entail and how it will evolve. The main ethos behind it is for it to be inclusive to anyone who wishes to take part.
